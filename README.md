## **Who are you? What is your background?**

* Iâ€™m Lucas! Iâ€™ve been in sales for the past 3 years since graduating with my B.S. in Management from the University of Arizona. I was also a sales manager for about a year and a finance intern as well. I recently just started a full-time position in NYC at Triplemint , a real estate brokerage, helping people buy/sell their homes throughout the city. We also use a lot of data science and algorithms to better understand the market and serve our clients. In my spare time I like messing around with adobe creative cloud, hiking, and snowboarding!

## **What are your career goals?**

* As of right now I'm still plotting my career course however, I would really like to pursue something within the FinTech space. I am currently looking into project management given my previous management experience, product development, business intelligence, or something in the blockchain space. 

## **Why did you choose FinTech as a career path?**

* I chose a career in FinTech in order to align myself more with where the future of finance is heading. I consider myself to be a lifetime learner and am really curious about what will be developed in this space in the future and would love to be a part of it. I love technology and am facinated by what you can accomplish with big data. I plan to expand my skillset in this more STEM realted field in order to remain employable and be able to understand the future of these emmerging technologies.
